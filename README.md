# Hello-world

Hello, abhishek here!

I like python and recently I started learning machine learning, and when I realized the potential that machine learning has I pushed myself further to learn how things work from simple linear regression to several layers deep neural networks. Also I got to know about unity and that introduced me to a whole new world of game development which intrigued me and I started with unity and one thing led to another and I ended up learning quite a few skills like game backends with php or Node.Js, blender, unity shader graphs, javascripts, websockets and got familiar with a lot more like godot, photoshop, krita etc. So, I would love to present my codes (in my other repository) that I made from scratch (or not) after learning about certain things.
