# Hello-world

Hello, abhishek here!

I like python and recently I started learning machine learning, and when I realized the potential that machine learning has I pushed myself further to learn how things work from simple linear regression to several layers deep neural networks. So, I would love to present my codes (in my other repository) that I made from scratch after learning what a certain algorithm intends to accomplish in the supervision of my mentor Mr. Jaskirat Singh.
