# Hello-world

Hello, abhishek here!

I am a MEAN Stack Developer and also familiar with Game Development with Unity. I also have good knowledge in machine learning. I work as MEAN stack developer at Bitace Technologies. In my journey I have learned quite a lot of new things and ways of doing things and am still keen on learning more. Here I would love to present my codes (in my other repository) that I made from scratch (or not) after learning about certain things.
